Virtual machines can run on various platforms including:
* on-premises data center 
* Public cloud providers
* Private cloud providers

## What determines how many can run?
The numbers of virtual machines can run depends on many factors such as the workload requirements of each VM, hardware resources: CPU, RAM or storage. Also, the capabitilies and limitations of the virtualisation software.

## What does a virtual machine include?
A typical VM usually includes:
* **Virtualise hardware** components such as virtual CPU, storage, RAM
* **Operating system** such as Linux, Windows or MacOS
* **Applications and services**
  
## What software is required to orchestrate/run the virtual machines?
